US Realm 
May 2017

The EMeasure_N1.xsd and POQM_MT000001UV03_CQL.xsd schemas in this folder are copied from the HQMF Normative release schemas and updated to reference the CQL-Based HQMF schema extensions defined in hhs-cql-hqmfn1-ext-v1.xsd. The changes are backwards compatible, meaning that these same schemas will work to validate any normative compliant HQMF document.
